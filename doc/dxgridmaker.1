.SH NAME
dxgridmaker - creates analysis grids using RADIANCE primitives
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dxgridmaker
[
.B options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dxgridmaker
creates an analysis points file for input to RADIANCE by use of RADIANCE primitives.  
Output for each point is:

	xorg yorg zorg xdir ydir zdir
.PP
The points file will be generated from the geometry described by the chosen modifiers.
The points will then be evenly distributed based on a spacing in the x and y directions as well
as offsets from the boundaries of the geometry.	
.PP
Options are given on the command line.
All options are followed by one argument, which must be
separated from the option by white space.
.TP 10n
.BI -f name
Set the input file name containing the RADIANCE primitives to 
.I name
.  Multiple files may be listed, however each file must have the '-f' option preceding it.
.TP
.BI -sx \ val
Set the spacing in the x direction to 
.I val .  '-sx' is required.
.TP
.BI -sy \ val
Set the spacing in the y direction to 
.I val .  '-sy' is required.
.TP
.BI -ox \ val
Set the offset in the x direction to 
.I val .  The minimum and maximum x coordinate values for the bounding box of the chosen polygons will changed by this value.
A positive value will move the extents towards the middle of the polygon.
.TP
.BI -oy \ val
Set the offset in the y direction to 
.I val .  The minimum and maximum y coordinate values for the bounding box of the chosen polygons will changed by this value.
A positive value will move the extents towards the middle of the polygon.
.TP
.BI -o \ val
Set the overall offset to 
.I val .  A positive value will create an inset of the chosen polygons after they have been joined together.
This will create a shape similar to that of the joined polygons only smaller. This may be useful for ignoring circulation space
at the boundary of a room.
.TP
.BI -oz \ val
Set the offset in the z direction to 
.I val .  The height of each analysis point will be set based on the average z height of the polygon for which it was created.
.TP
.BI -z \ val
Set the absolute height of the analysis points to 
.I val .  This is a global setting for all points.  Each of the created points will be set to the global value of 
.I val .
.TP
.BI -l \ name
Set the layer name that will be used to find the polygons for use in creating the analysis grid to 
.I name .  This layer name is equivalent to the modifier for the RADIANCE primitive of interest.  Multiple layer names may 
be listed, however each name must have the '-l' option preceding it.
.TP
.BI -t \ val
Set the threshold distance to  
.I val .  This option allows for geometry, that would be invalid due to offsets, to be ignored if the both dimensions are less than
.I val .  This could be useful for ignoring stair treads, but allowing larger polygons with the same layer name.
.TP
.BI -r \ name
Set the output file name to  
.I name .  The default output is the standard output.  The output will be sent to the standard output if this option is not set.
.TP
.BI -vp \ location
Set the directory that the files should be placed for creating a parallel projection bitmap to  
.I location .  This creates a preview of the analysis points as red spheres along with the geometry within the chosen layers.
This preview requires oconv, rpict, pfilt, and ra_bmp. A file named 'grid.bmp' will be found within 
.I location upon completion.  This view is useful for single plane points. 
.TP
.BI -vse \ location
Set the directory that the files should be placed for creating a south-east isometric bitmap to  
.I location .  This creates a preview of the analysis points as red spheres along with the geometry within the chosen layers.
This preview requires oconv, rpict, pfilt, and ra_bmp. A file named 'grid.bmp' will be found within 
.I location upon completion.  This view is useful for overlapping geometry at multiple levels.
.TP
.BI -vsw \ location
Set the directory that the files should be placed for creating a south-west isometric bitmap to  
.I location .  This creates a preview of the analysis points as red spheres along with the geometry within the chosen layers.
This preview requires oconv, rpict, pfilt, and ra_bmp. A file named 'grid.bmp' will be found within 
.I location upon completion.  This view is useful for overlapping geometry at multiple levels.
.TP
.BI -vne \ location
Set the directory that the files should be placed for creating a north-east isometric bitmap to  
.I location .  This creates a preview of the analysis points as red spheres along with the geometry within the chosen layers.
This preview requires oconv, rpict, pfilt, and ra_bmp. A file named 'grid.bmp' will be found within 
.I location upon completion.  This view is useful for overlapping geometry at multiple levels.
.TP
.BI -vnw \ location
Set the directory that the files should be placed for creating a north-west isometric bitmap to  
.I location .  This creates a preview of the analysis points as red spheres along with the geometry within the chosen layers.
This preview requires oconv, rpict, pfilt, and ra_bmp. A file named 'grid.bmp' will be found within 
.I location upon completion.  This view is useful for overlapping geometry at multiple levels.
.TP
.BI -csv \ name
Set the csv formatted output file name to  
.I name .

.SH EXAMPLES
To create a points file that is written to the standard output with spacing of 24 units in both directions and an inset of 24 units around the 
boundary of the polygons and the points placed at a height of 30 units above the polygons named 'floor':
.IP "" .2i
dxgridmaker \-f scene.rad \-sx 24 \-sy 24 \-o 24 \-oz 30 \-l floor > grid.pts
.PP
To create a points file that is written to a chosen file location and an absolute z height using a bounding box offset:
.IP "" .2i
dxgridmaker \-f scene.rad \-sx 2 \-sy 2 \-ox 1 \-oy 1 \-z 2.5 \-l floor \-l floor2 \-r calcpoints.pts
.SH ENVIRONMENT
RAYPATH		the directories to check for auxiliary files.
