STADIC Contribution Policy
==========================

In order to contribute to STADIC, developers must be able to contribute code under the STADIC license (see
the LICENSE file in the main repository directory). To make contributions to the code, developers should 
send an email to the developer contact containing the following text:

> I agree to contribute to the STADIC software package under the following terms and conditions: 
>
> * I agree that my contributions are submitted under the terms of the STADIC license.
>
> * I represent and warrant that I am authorized to make the contributions and grant the license. 
>   If my employer has rights to intellectual property that includes my contributions, I represent and 
>   warrant that I have received permission to make contributions and grant the required license on behalf
>   of my employer.

Once the developers have acknowledged the reciept of this email, new developers should review the developer
workflow document and follow that workflow for their contributions.
