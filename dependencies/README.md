Dependencies
============

This directory contains dependencies that are not directly part of STADIC but are distributed
with the source code. At present, the list is short:

* jsoncpp - JSON parsing code (from https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp, created
with the almalgamation.py script)
* boost-geometry-1_57.tar.gz - The geometry module of Boost 1.57 extracted with the BCP program.
